# ðŸ“œGrowth Crash Course Description

This course is designed for beginners to enrich knowledge about computer and the internet. How obvious it isnâ€™t, 90% of computer and Internet users are illiterate when it comes to a wider and deeper knowledge on how it actually works. The goal of this course is bring this stat 1% down.

This is not systematic going deep into details course. This is a roadmap, to show what can you do and what you don't know. If this sparks any initiative inside you, it has already accomplished its mission. Some parts are hectic, since the human brain needs to be injected some times different dimensions of information that the brain itself will organise later.

The main outcome of this course is to deliver knowledge, that is useful to you. Remember, useful means something you can use, to achieve your goals!
