# Commands are the key to efficiency

### Mac vs Windows

As a rule, in Mac you use `command ⌘` and in Windows `⌃` to trigger the command. I use Mac so all the description will be Mac-based. If you don't use them, it's really bad for you. It means that 40% of the time you are just clicking and doing nothing. Full lists of shortcuts for [Mac are here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236 "Mac shortcuts") and for [Windows are here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts "Windows Shortcuts"). Some filtered [great shorcuts here](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3023544/28-keyboard-shortcuts-mac-users-need-to-know.html "Mac additional shortcuts").
