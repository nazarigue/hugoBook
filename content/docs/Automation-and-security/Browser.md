# Browser vulnerability

Daily we use browser to interact with different services. Some services require information on what device we use, what is our network connection, what is the hardware. The browser can give information on your location, to provide a website with relevant region data. The problem is that we don't know what data do we exactly share.

## Start with recommended checks

Go to [Privacy Analyzer](https://privacy.net/analyzer/) and go through the procedure.
